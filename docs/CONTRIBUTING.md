# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Housing Hunt. This document covers the minimal steps to get started and how to submit changes.

Getting started

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Install dependencies and run the dev server locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Code style and linting

Follow the existing TypeScript style. Unless you think your style is better; I'm always open to new ideas and styles. As long as it is purposeful and makes sense. Who knows, maybe I'll adopt yours!

Work flow & PRs

- Open a focused pull request with a clear title and description.
- Link any related issue or context in the PR description.

Thank you for contributing!
